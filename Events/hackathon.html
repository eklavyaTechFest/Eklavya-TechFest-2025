      <h2>Important Guidelines for Hackathon Participants</h2>
      <p>All participants are required to develop their products/software before arriving at the hackathon. Additionally, each team must prepare a presentation that effectively explains their project.</p>
      <ul>
        On the day of the hackathon, teams will be expected to:
        <li><b>Showcase their product or software</b></li>
        <li><b>Present their idea, development process, and outcomes to the judges and audience</b></li>
        <li><b> Presentation time:- 12min</b></li>
        <li><b> No. of slides in the presentation:- 6 max</b></li>
      </ul>
     
      <p>Make sure your product and your presentation is ready and impactful — this will be a key part of your evaluation.</p>

                  <h4>Description:</h4>
                  <p>
                    India faces a complex challenge in balancing its reliance on
                    coal for energy with its climate change commitments. Coal
                    mining is a major source of carbon emissions, a greenhouse gas
                    contributing to global warming. To achieve carbon neutrality,
                    the Indian coal sector needs to offset its emissions. This can
                    be done through a combination of strategies like reducing
                    emissions from mining activities, adopting cleaner
                    technologies, and offsetting remaining emissions by planting
                    trees that absorb carbon dioxide. A web-based application can
                    be a powerful tool in this journey by helping quantify a
                    mine's carbon footprint and evaluate potential pathways to
                    carbon neutrality.
                  </p>
  
                  <p>The web based application will have following objectives:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Activity wise quantification of Carbon emission in Coal
                      Mines

                    <li>Estimation of existing Carbon Sinks</li>

                    In modern educational settings, managing classrooms
                    efficiently while ensuring a conducive learning environment is
                    crucial. Traditional methods of classroom management are often
                    manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error, which can
                    disrupt the learning process. Leveraging software-based
                    solutions in classroom management can enhance operational
                    efficiency, ensure safety, and create an engaging learning
                    atmosphere for students. This project aims to develop a smart
                    software solution to streamline classroom operations, improve
                    resource utilization, and enhance the overall learning
                    experience.

                    Visitors to museums often face several significant challenges
                    due to manual ticket booking systems. One prominent issue is
                    the inefficiency and time consumption associated with the
                    process. Long queues are common, especially during peak hours,
                    weekends, or special exhibitions, leading to frustration and
                    impatience among visitors. Besides the wait times, the manual
                    system is prone to errors, such as incorrect ticket issuance,
                    double bookings, or lost records, which can cause further
                    delays and inconvenience. Overall, these challenges associated
                    with manual ticket booking systems significantly detract from
                    the visitor experience, reducing satisfaction and potentially
                    impacting the museum's reputation and visitor numbers.

                    The implementation of a chatbot for ticket booking in a museum
                    addresses several critical needs, enhancing the overall
                    visitor experience and streamlining museum operations. Here
                    are the key reasons for adopting a chatbot ticket booking

                  <strong>Background:</strong> Coal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India, accounting for 55% of the country's energy needs. With coal-fired thermal power plants contributing around ¾ of total power generation—and being the biggest source of carbon emissions—there is an urgent need to address these emissions. India's updated NDC aims to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 (from 2005 levels), while still navigating energy security challenges.
